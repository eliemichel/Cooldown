Cooldown
========

![MIDI controller](doc/midi.gif)

Cooldown is a tool developed to help feeding some rhythm into live-coding tools such as [Veda](https://veda.gl/) or [Kodelife](https://hexler.net/products/kodelife). Beats can be tapped on a MIDI controller and read in GLSL as texture data.

Building
--------

Cooldown is a regular Rust project. You can just run `cargo build` to build the project.

Usage
-----

You must provide as argument the address to which Cooldown will send the OSC messages, e.g. `cooldown 127.0.0.1:3615`. To receive this in Veda, add to the veda config this entry: `{ "osc": 3615 }`. To send OSC messages to KodeLife, I made a simple companion tool: [OscToSpout](https://github.com/eliemichel/OscToSpout).

Emitted OSC messages are:

    /time [current time in seconds]
    /beat1 [beat time] [frequency] [phase] [velocity]
    /beat2 ...
    ...

Limitations
-----------

Most limitations are due to the fact that this is a project developed mainly for myself, that I share for the sake of openness but that remains a personal tool.

 - The indexes of the MIDI input buttons are hard-coded to fit my own MIDI controller.
 - The code is not well organized and almost not commented.
